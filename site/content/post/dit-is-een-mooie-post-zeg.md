## What Is A Pinned Post? And Why Pin A Post On Facebook?

A pinned post is like a note tacked to a bulletin board. It’s a status update saved to the top of your page so it’s the first thing page visitors see and it doesn’t join older posts below the fold. 

Considering the amount of information that accounts constantly post to their profiles, it can get difficult for your followers to find the most important information you need them to know. This is the value of pinning your posts. 

You can use them to: 

* Emphasize important information like your latest campaign or products
* Update customers
* Share a warm welcome with visitors
* Announce rules for the page
* Bypass the Facebook algorithm and get people to see your post no matter how much time has passed

Unfortunately, you can only have one pinned post at a time and it will remain pinned for 7 days. Another downside, the feature isn’t available on personal Facebook accounts, only [Pages](https://www.facebook.com/business/pages), and [Groups](https://www.facebook.com/help/1629740080681586). 

## How To Pin A Post On Facebook

If you’re looking to improve the performance of your brand or business page, here’s how to pin a post on Facebook.

### How To Pin A Post On Facebook Pages

1. Login via your app or web platform. 
2. Navigate to the page with the post you wish to pin (P.S. Only page administrators can do this.)
3. Find the content you want to save.
4. Once there, click on the three dots or drop-down menu for options to apply to the post. 
5. Choose **“Pin to top of page”**. The post should move to the top of the page with a pushpin on it. 
6. If you want to unpin the post later on, select the drop-down menu and select **“Unpin from top of page.”**

### How To Pin A Post On Facebook Groups

You’ve seen how to pin a post on Facebook pages, but the process is slightly different for how to pin a post on Facebook groups. The post also looks a little different from the Pages posts as it uses the Facebook announcements feature, which is exclusive to groups. Facebook allows groups to have up to 10 announcements but only one pinned announcement. 

Here’s how to create a Group announcement: 

1. Log in to your Facebook and open the group you want to use for the announcement. You need to be the group moderator to do this. 
2. Go to the post you want to announce. If you want to use a completely new post, then you’ll have to create it first. 
3. Once you’re looking at the right post, click on the three-dot menu.
4. Select **“Mark as announcement.”**
5. If you want to remove the announcement later on, open the three-dot menu and select **“Remove announcement.”**

How to pin a post-announcement on Facebook:

6. Click on the three-dot menu. 
7. Choose **“Pin to top.”**
8. If you want to unpin, select **“Unpin to top.”**

Plus, announcements have an even extra feature: *notifications!* Every time you post an announcement, your group members get a notification. So, whether they’re scrolling through their feed or not even using Facebook, they’ll know what’s happening in the group.
